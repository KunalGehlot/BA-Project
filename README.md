# EuroPet Marketing Analytics Case Study

## Introduction

The EuroPet case study, authored by Karl Schmedders and I. Campbell Lyle from Kellogg School of Management, explores the complex relationship between convenience store (c-store) sales and advertising expenditures on TV and radio channels. This analysis aims to dissect the effectiveness of advertising spending by examining its impact on sales through the lens of Gross Rating Points (GRPs). The core focus lies in understanding how advertising influences sales outcomes and the financial viability of such investments within a fiercely competitive retail setting.

The study employs rigorous statistical methods to assess the correlation between c-store sales and advertising mediums. It seeks to answer critical questions regarding the statistical significance of advertising efforts, the predictability of sales based on GRPs, and the economic rationale behind advertising expenditures. The ultimate goal is to furnish marketers with practical insights for refining advertising strategies to boost sales and profitability.
